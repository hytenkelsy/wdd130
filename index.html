            <p>Hello! My name is Kelsy, and I am living in Las Vegas with my husband and beautiful little girl.
                I have a little boy on the way and am so excited to meet him this December. I am currently a
                middle school math teacher, but have a desire to work from home and home school eventually, as well as
                foster infants.
                My husband is seeking to obtain a job on an Air Force Base as a 911 dispatcher, and he
                is working on obtaining multiple certifications to help him acheive this.
            </p>

            <p>Las Vegas is known for the Strip and it's many casinos, but it is so much more than that. The people here
                are very kind and want to do good for the people around them. There is also always something to do and
                skill to learn.</p>
