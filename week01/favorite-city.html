    <h1>Kelsy's Favorite City - Cheyenne, Wyoming</h1>
    <p>Cheyenne is a great city with a small town vibe. It is on an intersection of two<br>
        major interstate highways, so it is easy to access from every direction. Once a year, <br>
        they also have Cheyenne Frontier Days, a huge outdoor rodeo. They have a carnival outside <br>
        all day and a concert every night of the rodeo. There is something to do for everyone. </p>
